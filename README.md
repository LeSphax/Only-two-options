# Only-two-options

When I started creating this game, I wanted to create a the "I can see the end but I don't seem to get closer" feeling.
I also wanted to try to make something which would feel like a level from the game "Antichamber".
This is why I found a quote and turned the level around it.

I had a friend try it and I realized that as it is it isn't really interesting, the player doesn't feel very proud to finish the game.
To improve it I have thought about creating obstacles like projectiles to dodge.
The player would have to overcome while going towards the end of the tunnel.

As he would progress he would be able to read messages, these messages would have to feel like self doubt or people discouraging him.
"You're making no progress" or "How much time have you been running this way" "Why do you even try"

As he would progress further, the messages would be more obvious and guide him so he could finish the game.
"Are there no other options?" "Is this the only way?".
